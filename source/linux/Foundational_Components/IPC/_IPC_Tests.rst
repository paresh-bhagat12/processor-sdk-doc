Overview
========

The IPC product contains unit tests under the following directories.

-  linux/src/tests
-  qnx/src/tests
-  packages/ti/ipc/tests

These are meant to be used as unit tests and documentation of the tests
are currently sparse.

Linux Unit tests
----------------

These tests under linux/src/tests have a Linux host application binary
and the binaries for the respective slave cores used in the test are
located under packages/ti/ipc/tests.

**NOTE**: Loading of the slave cores in general is achieved by using
remoteproc or MPM control procedures, which are specific to the platform
and are out of scope for this page.

Single thread MessageQ tests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

MessageQApp: Sends single messages to slave cores and gets messages sent
back from slave cores.

Msgq100: Specific unit test to test MessageQ_get when messages are
available from more than one remote core.

MessageQBench: Send and get back single messages and measures round trip
delay.

These unit test binaries can be built with the following commands ( See
`IPC Linux Install Guide <index_Foundational_Components.html#linux-install-guide>`_ for more
details on setting up variables)

::

       make -f ipc-linux.mak config
       make
       make install

NOTE: The Host linux binaries are located at the DESTDIR/bin.

|
| All these tests use the messageq_single.\* binaries loaded on the
  slave cores.

For example:

For the ipu1 core on AM57x/DRA7xx use:

::

       ./packages/ti/ipc/tests/bin/ti_platforms_evmDRA7XX_ipu1/messageq_single.xem4

For all the DSP cores on K2HK use:

::

       ./packages/ti/ipc/tests/bin/ti_platforms_evmTCI6638K2K_core0/messageq_single.xe66

Qnx Unit tests
--------------

These tests under qnx/src/tests have a Qnx host application binary and
the binaries for the respective slave cores used in the test are located
under packages/ti/ipc/tests.

  Loading of the slave cores in general is achieved by using the
  ipc binary.
